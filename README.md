# Tetris
## Description
This is my tetris game. It's god awful! :D
It's written in play-clj (a lib-GDX wrapper library for clojure), just run the STANDALONE jar file and you're good to go!
## Bugs
Note that I couldn't get the scoring to work, so as a last minute ditch, the score prints are printed to terminal.
Also, the game doesn't end either, you'll have to restart to play again. Those are the only huge bugs though.
